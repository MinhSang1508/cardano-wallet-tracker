# Intro

**Bridgeless swaps** are not just another incremental improvement to cross-chain DeFi—they are the **paradigm shift** that will redefine how assets move between blockchains. For years, the industry has relied on traditional token bridges, which, despite their convenience, introduce systemic vulnerabilities: custodial choke points, fragmented liquidity silos, and a long history of devastating bridge exploits. Every wrapped token becomes a claim on a distant custodian, not a true asset—undermining decentralization at its core.

Our approach eliminates these weaknesses entirely. **No token wrapping. No custodial dependencies. No fragmented liquidity.** Instead, we enable **direct, trustless swaps** between native assets across heterogeneous chains, with settlement **mathematically guaranteed** through **cryptographic proofs** rather than trusted intermediaries. This is the foundation for a truly **composable, borderless DeFi ecosystem** where assets can move freely without compromise.

We focus on harnessing **Cardano’s Extended UTxO (EUTxO) model**—renowned for its determinism, scalability, and smart contract flexibility—and bridging it seamlessly with both **EVM-compatible** and **non-EVM chains** via **Wanchain’s XFlows** framework. By extending Wanchain’s **Lock-Mint-Burn-Unlock** primitives to support **pure swap semantics**, we are building a universal liquidity layer that **unlocks cross-chain interoperability without the baggage of legacy bridging**.

The result: **instant, finality-driven swaps** between native assets, safeguarded by verifiable proofs, unlocking the full potential of multi-chain DeFi while preserving the sovereignty of each blockchain.
