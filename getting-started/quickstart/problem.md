# Problem

* Many crypto portfolio tracking tools offer convenience, but user **privacy and security** remain major concerns due to the **decentralized nature of blockchain**.
* The habit of **frequently checking wallet balances** can unintentionally expose sensitive information — especially for wallets with large holdings.
* Using tools like **Telegram bots or blockchain explorers** may reveal:
  * IP address
  * Wallet address
  * Asset balances\
    → to server owners or bot operators, increasing the risk of **cyberattacks or real-world threats**.
* Despite these risks, a major advantage of public blockchains is **free and open access to data anytime, anywhere**.
* Users can leverage **open-source tools, APIs, and cloud services** (e.g., Google Sheets, BigQuery) to query data securely **without third-party intermediaries** or cost.
