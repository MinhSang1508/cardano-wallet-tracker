# Proposal

#### \[SOLUTION] Please describe your proposed solution

**Context and problem.**

* Currently, Cardano only has one mobile wallet app, Yoroi, which consistently faces issues with blockchain data synchronization.
* The habits and level of understanding of most users involve checking their assets through mobile wallets. When the Yoroi wallet encounters synchronization problems, users are unable to check their assets.
* Checking and monitoring assets through explorers is limited by the necessity to use a PC or laptop.
* There are already some apps or bots that help track wallet assets; however, to some extent, users who value their privacy may choose not to use them.
* For example, when users use a Telegram bot to query wallet asset information, the bot owner can know your Telegram ID, which addresses you hold assets in, how much assets you have, and even the IP address from which you are connecting to the internet.
* Many regular users want to create their own tracking tools to monitor their assets daily and as they wish without needing a PC or using a third-party app. However, creating, programming, or deploying a bot requires time for research and may involve costs for renting an online server…
* Cardano has many API sources that provide free blockchain data. Most of these projects creating these APIs are funded by the Catalyst fund. However, their popularity is not yet high.

**Solution**

Starting from real needs, we will create documentation to guide users in creating their own Telegram bot to monitor asset fluctuations in their wallets. The documentation includes:

* **Documentation and Videos:** Guides on how to create and deploy a Telegram bot.
* **Using Free APIs:** Instructions on how to utilize free API sources.
* **Bot Source Code Documentation:** Detailed documentation of the bot's source code.

**Bot Functions:**

* **Track ADA Balance Fluctuations:** Monitor ADA balances by stake address and payment address.
* **Track Cardano Token Balance Fluctuations:** Monitor Cardano token balances by stake address and payment address.
* **Manual Tracking Mode:** Check at any time.
* **Auto Tracking Mode:** Every minute.
* **Daily and Weekly Modes:** Set tracking intervals.
* **Notifications:** Include transaction ID (tx id) and on-chain messages accompanying the transaction.
* **Notification Delivery:** Sent via Telegram or email.
* **Periodic Asset Reports:** Track and send reports about wallet assets to users on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.

_Note: Feel free to use my bot (Vietnamese version)_

**Advantages of the Solution:**

* **Convenience for Busy or Mobile Users:** Ideal for those who are busy, frequently on the move, do not regularly use a computer, or do not want to frequently install the Yoroi wallet app on their mobile devices.
* **Zero Cost:**
* **Blockchain Data Queries:** Free (using public APIs like Koios, Blockfrost, etc.).
* **Bot Deployment Server Fees:** Free (using Google’s free cloud server).
* **Database:** Free and easy to use with Google Sheets.
* **Bot Source Code:** Simple, utilizing Google AppScript code.
* **Google Account:** Free.
* **Telegram Bot:** Always free.
* **Faster Result Retrieval:** Provides quicker access to results compared to using explorer websites or wallet apps.

#### \[IMPACT] Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community

**Impact and benefit**

* **ADA holders** now have an additional convenient solution to track assets in their personal wallets, aside from using wallet apps, blockchain explorers, or third-party software.
* **Cost-saving solution:** No deployment costs… all resources used are free and familiar to millions of people worldwide (Google).
* **Promotes and enhances awareness and usability** of the available public APIs on Cardano. The expected sources are Blockfrost and Koios.
* **Non-developer holders** who master the bot will also gain additional knowledge about the Cardano blockchain.

**Key metrics to measure the success of the project**

* Number of bot functions.
* Number of bot users.
* Number of public API sources used.

**Main goal (6 months)**

* **Goal 1: Number of bot functions. This goal is defined by the following parameter:**
* Number of bot functions: **5**
* **Goal 2: Number of interactions with the product. This goal is determined by the number of times the code is forked from GitHub.**
* Forked times: **100**
* **Goal 3: Number of direct support cases.**
* Support number: **20 users**
* **Goal 4: Number of public API sources used.**
* Number of API sources: **2** (Blockfrost + Koios)

#### \[CAPABILITY & FEASIBILITY] What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability? How do you intend to validate if your approach is feasible?
